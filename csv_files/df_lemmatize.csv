Strongly Anti-GMO,engineers design plants using genetically modified organisms gmos to improve taste nutritional content and resilience however people have concerns over their safety and there is much debate about the pros and cons of using gmos scientists create gmo foods by introducing genetic material or dna from a different organism through genetic engineering most of the currently available gmo foods are plants such as fruit and vegetables in the united states thefood and drug administration fda regulates all foods from genetically engineered plants they must meet the same safety requirements as non gmo foods gmo foods arelikely to becomea crucial tool in feeding the world s growing population especially in areas with harsh climates however there have been concerns about possible risks this article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of gmo crops including their potential effects on human health and the environment manufacturers use genetic modification to give foods desirable traits potential advantages ofgmocrops include attractiveness to consumers resilience nutritional value and less waste gmo crops may be increasingly attractive to consumers examples of this include apples and potatoes that areless likelyto bruise or turn brown some believe that gmo foods may have an enhanced flavor compared to non gmo foods however there isno evidenceto show that genetic modification has any effect on the taste smell or appearance of foods in the u s in fact most people cannot tell the difference between gmo and non gmo foods most gmo crops in the u s were developed to help farmers they are more resilient crops that help prevent crop and food loss some of the reasons farmers choose to grow gmo cropsinclude gmo crops may also bemore resistantto harsh climates such as drought heat and salty soils this can help increase the growth of crops in areas where food security is a concern certain genes in gmo foods may also help increase the shelf life of foods again decreasing food waste certain types of gmos may add nutritional value to foods anexample of thisis golden rice this is a product that is engineered to provide higher levels of vitamin a to consumers while it can provide nutritional value to those who eat it especially in areas where vitamin a deficiency is an issue the growth of this product is not widespread it is not currently a part of the u s food system growing plants that are more resistant to diseases spread by insects or viruses will likely result in higher yields for farmers and a more attractive product all these factors can contribute to lower costs for the consumer and can ensure that more people have access to quality food genetically engineering foods is a relatively new practice which means the long term effects on safety are not yet clear many concerns about the disadvantages relate to human health scientists have not yet shown that gmo foods are harmful to health but research is ongoing there is a small risk that gmo foods can trigger an allergic reaction but this will only happen if the genetic change triggers the production of an allergen for instance if scientists combine a gene from a brazil nut with a soybean there is aslight chancethat a person with a nut allergy could have an allergic reaction to products made with the soybean theworld health organization who discourages genetic engineers from using dna from allergens unless they can prove that the proteins that the gene produces do not cause allergies scientists assess the likelihood of gmo foods causing an allergic reaction in humans before a product reaches the market and can prevent its launch if necessary there have been concerns that eating gmo foods can contribute to the development ofcancerby raising levels of potentially carcinogenic substances in the body theamerican cancer societystates there is no evidence that currently available gmo foods either increase or reduce the risk of cancer while cancer rateshave changedover time in the u s there is no evidence that these changes coincide with the introduction of gmo foods if there is a link it could take several more years before a trend emerges some gmos contain changes that make them resistant to certainantibiotics in theory the genes from these plants could enter humans or animals when they eat them as a result the person or animal could also develop antibiotic resistance the likelihood of this happening isvery small but thewhoand other health authorities have guidelines in place to prevent it in olderresearch from some food scientists noted that food dna can survive as far as the gut and there have been concerns that this could affect the immune system some people have also raised fears that eating gmo food could lead to genetic changes in humans however most of the dna in food whether gmo or not either is destroyed by cooking or breaks down before it reaches the large intestine small fragments of dna from food can and do enter the bloodstream and body organs but there isno evidencethat they have any impact on genetic makeup or human health in olderresearch from some researchers suggested that gmo foods might impact the liver kidney pancreas and reproductive system they did not have evidence to confirm this and called for further studies the use of gmo cropsmay even reducethe risk of toxicity from some substances as farmers may be able to reduce the use of pesticides climate change and severe weather eventsare disruptingfood production and supply gmo foods could help maintain supplies in the face of changing environmental conditions and a growing population genetically modifying some foods could make them also a studysuggests gmo foods could help slow climate change by reducing greenhouse gases environmental concernsinclude the risks will vary depending on local conditions in the u s thefdadoes not require special labeling for gmo foods this is because they must meet the same safety standards as other foods and there should be no need for additional regulation however a gmo food needs a special label if it is materially different from its conventional counterpart for example however the national bioengineered food disclosure standardstates that all foods containing genetically engineered ingredients must now carry the label derived from bioengineering or bioengineered specificsymbolsshow whether a food has been bioengineered the following are the most common gmo crops produced and sold in the u s derivatives of these foods such as cornstarch and sugar also feature in other manufactured foods it is worth noting that of all sugar beet harvested in the u s is gmo as well as over of all canola corn soybean and cotton foods that are bioengineered and products that contain bioengineered foodsmust carrya specific label if a product does not have this kind of label it does not contain bioengineered ingredients foods that are likely to be gmoinclude many gmo crops also become ingredients in other foods for example genetic modification is when scientistsinsertnew dna into the gene pool of an existing plant for this to happen the following needs to take place for thousands of years people have used processes such as selective breeding or crossbreeding to produce more viable crops however changes took a long time to achieve and it was hard to make specific changes in recent years developments in genetic engineering have allowed scientists to make specific changes more quickly the crops produced in this way are called gmo crops the first gmo food to appear on the market was a tomato in below we answer some questions people often ask about gmo foods the likelihood that any food derived from corn cottonseed soybean canola or sugar beet will be gmo food in the u s is or higher there is no specific gmo food to avoid gmo foods undergostrict testingbefore they can be commercialized moreover this could make them safer than other foods which do not undergo testing currently there isno evidencethat gmo foods cause cancer allergies or any other health conditions however research is ongoing health authorities vet all gmos and other foods for safety before manufacturers can sell them and research is ongoing so far scientists have foundno evidencethat commercially available gmo foods are dangerous for health environmental concernsincludethe risk of altered genes entering wild species genetic modification can make plants resistant to disease and tolerant of herbicides and therefore the process can increase the amount of food that farmers can grow this in turn can reduce food prices and contribute to food security gmo crops are relatively new and researchers are still investigating their long term safety and health effects but no evidence has yet emerged that currently available gmo foods are harmful to human health,engineer design plant using genetically modified organism gmos to improve taste nutritional content and resilience however people have concern over their safety and there is much debate about the pro and con of using gmos scientist create gmo food by introducing genetic material or dna from a different organism through genetic engineering most of the currently available gmo food are plant such a fruit and vegetable in the united state thefood and drug administration fda regulates all food from genetically engineered plant they must meet the same safety requirement a non gmo food gmo food arelikely to becomea crucial tool in feeding the world s growing population especially in area with harsh climate however there have been concern about possible risk this article discus the advantage and disadvantage of gmo crop including their potential effect on human health and the environment manufacturer use genetic modification to give food desirable trait potential advantage ofgmocrops include attractiveness to consumer resilience nutritional value and le waste gmo crop may be increasingly attractive to consumer example of this include apple and potato that areless likelyto bruise or turn brown some believe that gmo food may have an enhanced flavor compared to non gmo food however there isno evidenceto show that genetic modification ha any effect on the taste smell or appearance of food in the u s in fact most people can not tell the difference between gmo and non gmo food most gmo crop in the u s were developed to help farmer they are more resilient crop that help prevent crop and food loss some of the reason farmer choose to grow gmo cropsinclude gmo crop may also bemore resistantto harsh climate such a drought heat and salty soil this can help increase the growth of crop in area where food security is a concern certain gene in gmo food may also help increase the shelf life of food again decreasing food waste certain type of gmos may add nutritional value to food anexample of thisis golden rice this is a product that is engineered to provide higher level of vitamin a to consumer while it can provide nutritional value to those who eat it especially in area where vitamin a deficiency is an issue the growth of this product is not widespread it is not currently a part of the u s food system growing plant that are more resistant to disease spread by insect or virus will likely result in higher yield for farmer and a more attractive product all these factor can contribute to lower cost for the consumer and can ensure that more people have access to quality food genetically engineering food is a relatively new practice which mean the long term effect on safety are not yet clear many concern about the disadvantage relate to human health scientist have not yet shown that gmo food are harmful to health but research is ongoing there is a small risk that gmo food can trigger an allergic reaction but this will only happen if the genetic change trigger the production of an allergen for instance if scientist combine a gene from a brazil nut with a soybean there is aslight chancethat a person with a nut allergy could have an allergic reaction to product made with the soybean theworld health organization who discourages genetic engineer from using dna from allergen unless they can prove that the protein that the gene produce do not cause allergy scientist ass the likelihood of gmo food causing an allergic reaction in human before a product reach the market and can prevent it launch if necessary there have been concern that eating gmo food can contribute to the development ofcancerby raising level of potentially carcinogenic substance in the body theamerican cancer societystates there is no evidence that currently available gmo food either increase or reduce the risk of cancer while cancer rateshave changedover time in the u s there is no evidence that these change coincide with the introduction of gmo food if there is a link it could take several more year before a trend emerges some gmos contain change that make them resistant to certainantibiotics in theory the gene from these plant could enter human or animal when they eat them a a result the person or animal could also develop antibiotic resistance the likelihood of this happening isvery small but thewhoand other health authority have guideline in place to prevent it in olderresearch from some food scientist noted that food dna can survive a far a

Strongly Pro-GMO,gmo crops are perfectly safe and healthy and are good for the earth almost all of our food today in terms of grain crops has been modified and cultured in some way of course it s not like they used crispr on corn two hundred years ago but there is more than one way to modify food with those modifications though come some serious controversies people believe that these genetically modified crops can have a massively negative impact on our environment which is often enforce by the mainstream media i don t mean to scream fake news as there is some real research there but it doesn t tend to look at the entire picture in an in depth study conducted over years involving more than maize and soy farms researchers found that initial results of crops that produced their own herbicide and insecticide was positive though over time weeds began to develop a resistance to the natural herbicide causing many farmers to resort to buying their herbicide from manufacturers however this study was conducted not only on the impact on the farmers not the farm but also by an economist not a biologist geneticist or even an anthropologist it also focuses on one of the more recent modifications one that only became prevalent in the usa after when the environmental protection agency made it legal crops have been bred and modified for thousands of years with one of the earliest examples being that of corn which would have originally looked something closer to teosinte or zea luxurians a type of wild grass from central and south america eaten some years ago grobman much of the corn we have today looks nothing like luxurians being almost a completely different species zea mays it grows well and due to its natural domestication and modification through selective breeding has a much lower impact on its environment than its gmo counterparts these crops are plentiful clean and healthy for both us as humans and the environment they re grown in that being said there are some advantages that those gmo crops have over naturally bred produce many farmers have begun to recognize the ease with which gmo crops can grow even if consumers don t recognize the benefits that s why from to less than ten years the amount of gmo produce grown increased from to approximately hectares world wide that number has only grown despite popular opinion that gmos are poisonous and toxic there is a god chance you ve eaten some form of modified or specially bred crop whether store bought in a restaurant or out of a vending machine many people consider gmo crops to be poisonous or toxic according to an article in scientific american many people believe that gmos are bad for their health even poisonous and that they damage the environment this is in spite of overwhelming scientific evidence that proves that gmos are safe to eat and that they bring environmental benefits blancke these people refuse to eat gmo crops depending on their own feelings and assumptions about genetics i e adding fish genes to tomatoes will make them taste fishy they don t these people refuse to accept scientific evidence of helpful gmo crops similar to someone denying the positive medical effects of vaccines there is a plethora of scientific evidence for gmos from positive environmental effects to economic advantages for farmers gmo crops have other than in select cases a very positive influence on the environment specifically in terms of conservation of habitats gmos have in general a much larger crop yield meaning that they are more sustainable and can feed more people with less land thompson this means that natural ecosystems that otherwise would have been razed to make room for more farmland can now flourish in the way they would have had they never been adulterated by human development that being said many poorer subsistence farmers cannot afford these space saving gmos nor do they desire them determined to remain dead set in the agricultural practice known as slash and burn agriculture this is when a farmer or land company cuts down and burns a section of rainforest to clear out space farms it intensely until the soil is exhausted of nutrients then moves on to a new piece of land if these people would adopt the new gm crops as well as modernized forms of rotational agriculture land would be much more sustainable and even profitable after a time another form of gmo crops are crops that produce their own insecticide don t confuse that with herbicide another form of gmo with negative influence on a farm insecticide crops produce essentially natural pesticides this is by use of a gene that is active against insects taken from the bacteria bacillus thuringiensis or bt these come in two primary forms known commonly as bt cotton and bt maize each are grown separately and with their own drawbacks and advantages bt cotton bt cotton is widely accepted and not heavily contested as it is not consumed as food so we won t spend much time on it it is grown all around the world with the primary advantage of course being a lack of pesticide use cotton farmers used more pesticide than any other farmers previous to the introduction of bt cotton thompson as there is essentially no demand for organic cotton so no one particularly cared of course people only really care about things that affect them so it s understandable that no one would bat an eye about millions of square miles of land and ecosystem being systematically poisoned by thousands of farmers for decades if no one cared you might ask why make bt cotton a thing the answer my friend is in the economics a farmer has to pay for his insecticide and if around four million pounds of it is dumped on cotton a year that s a lot of money going to insecticide companies which means a lot of money leaving the hands of farmers for instance million usd a year for china alone thompson cotton typically requires between five to twelve sprays with insecticide yearly depending on the region it s grown in when bt cotton was introduced people began to only need to spray cotton three to four times a year at most nine at least one which cut pesticide use by around bear in mind that of us farmers still grow natural cotton thompson which is fantastic just another two million pounds to go bt maize bt maize is a much more touchy subject for most people it s used in everything breads pastries soft drinks and of course corn corn itself is not natural obviously so what makes bt corn worse believe it or not nothing the first type of bt corn was designed to keep insects away and as a side effect make farmers spend less on pesticides thompson that being said the economic factor is not as large as it is with cotton according to the epa their analysis of bt crops finds that they pose no significant risk to the environment or to human health although there are some cons to using specific forms of experimental gmo crops i e crops that produce their own herbicide the pros of almost all gmo crops far outweigh any minimal cons there is a slight possibility that their impact will only be felt in long term effects but we can never really be sure the simplicity of moving agriculture from medieval england the the twenty first century is to adopt gmo crops as a source of food with a population of billion and growing the only way for humans to survive and still conserve the natural world is to adopt higher yield gmo crops internationally much of the stigma around gmos is similar to the popular fear of gluten a harmless chemical found in grain that for some reason twenty and thirty

almost all of our food today in term of grain crop ha been modified and cultured in some way of course it s not like they used crispr on corn two hundred year ago but there is more than one way to modify food with those modification though come some serious controversy people believe that these genetically modified crop can have a massively negative impact on our environment which is often enforce by the mainstream medium i don t mean to scream fake news a there is some real research there but it doesn t tend to look at the entire picture in an in depth study conducted over year involving more than maize and soy farm researcher found that initial result of crop that produced their own herbicide and insecticide wa positive though over time weed began to develop a resistance to the natural herbicide causing many farmer to resort to buying their herbicide from manufacturer however this study wa conducted not only on the impact on the farmer not the farm but also by an economist not a biologist geneticist or even an anthropologist it also focus on one of the more recent modification one that only became prevalent in the usa after when the environmental protection agency made it legal crop have been bred and modified for thousand of year with one of the earliest example being that of corn which would have originally looked something closer to teosinte or zea luxurians a type of wild grass from central and south america eaten some year ago grobman much of the corn we have today look nothing like luxurians being almost a completely different specie zea may it grows well and due to it natural domestication and modification through selective breeding ha a much lower impact on it environment than it gmo counterpart these crop are plentiful clean and healthy for both u a human and the environment they re grown in that being said there are some advantage that those gmo crop have over naturally bred produce many farmer have begun to recognize the ease with which gmo crop can grow even if consumer don t recognize the benefit that s why from to le than ten year the amount of gmo produce grown increased from to approximately hectare world wide that number ha only grown despite popular opinion that gmos are poisonous and toxic there is a god chance you ve eaten some form of modified or specially bred crop whether store bought in a restaurant or out of a vending machine many people consider gmo crop to be poisonous or toxic according to an article in scientific american many people believe that gmos are bad for their health even poisonous

https www reddit com r vegetarian comments ekq hm comment lgmgh v utm source share utm medium web x utm name web xcss utm term utm content share button not only that but in many cases gmos are higher quality produce in general including flavor the reason so much grocery store produce tastes bland or outright bad is because of harvesting i e ripening practices stuff gets picked way before it s ripe and is then exposed to ethylene to get it to take on color and for those scared of chemical y words no ethylene is perfectly safe every fruit you have ever had produces it on its own but yeah your non gmo organic produce would taste just as bad if it was mass produced and processed in this manner what s higher quality non gmo and organic have the qualities we need in produce gmo is genetically modified to look good longer shelf life extended and costs are less to the consumer but one major component is missing they only contain half or less of the nutrients that s why it s a choice to buy

Strongly Pro-GMO,why is a laissez faire attitude towards gmo crops the norm in skeptic communities techno utopianism in general seems to be the norm let me start by stating the obvious even given what little empirical data we have the human health claims that contribute to gmo skepticism of the general public are unfounded and most are far fetched however bad or even disingenuous arguments against gmos do not rule out the existence of good arguments against gmos the general public at least in their current state has a predilection to reaction conspiracism and superstition as such you can find a lot of low hanging fruit on any side of any debate when researching this topic it s important to attempt to steel man positions on both side as well as get a good grasp on definitions as they are used by the researchers using them what you find when you steel man gmo criticism by far the most credible and thoughtful concerns are coming from mainstream biology and the environmental sciences the concern is primarily that genetically modified organisms pose a considerable risk to native biodiversity source muir howard possible ecological risks of transgenic organism release when transgenes affect mating success sexual selection and the trojan gene hypothesis pnas https doi org pnas https doi org pnas researchers used a deterministic model to predict the outcome of the introduction of

https doi org j envres https doi org j envres direct impacts include gene transfer trait effects to non target species as well as wild life invasiveness weediness and genetic recombination of free dna in the environment on the contrary indirect impacts include harmful and side effects of chemical control i e reduced efficiency of pest disease and weed control the effect on water and soil and global decline of biodiversity tutelyan there has even been some thorough confirmation of these concerns found while studying spillover events of gmo crops source sohn et al a review of the unintentional release of feral genetically modified rapeseed into the environment biology https doi org biology https doi org biology gm canola or rapeseed is a gmo weed that breeds with other weeds passing on its herbicide tolerance r apeseed can produce wild populations in succeeding crops or appear as a volunteer outside of the crop area it has a number of wild relatives and is commonly found in central
