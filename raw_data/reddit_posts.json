        "selftext": "I expect comments might say this is common knowledge. I will point out that a lot of people don't know about GMOs or science in general, including some of my own friends and family. This post is meant to address those people.\n\nThe only legitimate controversies over GMOs involve ethical or environmental concerns. One example is Belgian Blue, a breed of cattle that contains extra muscles. Critics say it is unethical to create that kind of cow. Note that the issue here is NOT human health. The cows themselves are perfectly safe to eat.\n\nI will repeat what I said in the title: GMOs have no established health risks in humans. In some cases, they are actually beneficial to humans. Consider golden rice, a modified version of rice that contains added precursors for vitamin A. This was meant to combat vitamin A deficiency in Asia, which can lead to blindness. The public\u2019s perception of GMOs prevented golden rice from succeeding, as was addressed in a letter from over 100 Nobel prize laureates (discussed [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/29/more-than-100-nobel-laureates-take-on-greenpeace-over-gmo-stance/)).\n\nGMOs do not cause cancer. They are created by inserting a non-naturally occurring gene or mutation into an organism which is then consumed by humans. While it is established that genetic modification can cause cancer, that would occur in the original organism, *not the consumer*. Genetic modifications are not passed between organisms. If you find yourself questioning that statement, consider the fact that genetic diseases are not transmissible.\n\nThere is an article from a Harvard blog that reinforces a lot of what I have said. [Check it out](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/will-gmos-hurt-my-body/) if you\u2019re interested, and I encourage you to do your own research as well.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing a lot of people address the bad business models (mainly Monsanto and overuse of pesticides). These are all valid complaints. I merely wanted to address the public illusion about the GMOs themselves.",

        "selftext": "This isn\u2019t really an opinion but everyone seems to think so. I\u2019m under the impression that people don\u2019t even know what genetically modified even means and everyone is falling for propaganda that companies are using to mark up their products. \n\nGenetically modified crops, most of the time, are crops that have been through artificial selection. That means we noticed a couple of plants that we were growing produced bigger fruit with less seeds or they are less likely to die from weather or from pests or etc, so bred them with each other to create the plant that we enjoy today. This is something that happens naturally through evolution and natural selection as well. There\u2019s nothing crazy or unhealthy about it. It doesn\u2019t change the fruit or vegetables nutrition very much and it certainly doesn\u2019t make it less healthy. \n\nAnother way we genetically modify, which is less likely, is that we give the plant DNA that does all the things artificial selection does like pest resistance, longer growing season, bigger fruit, etc. except it takes a way shorter time. it is actually very helpful environmentally because it reduces the use pesticides. There arent any adverse health effects- it\u2019s still just a fruit or vegetable. There are positive environmental effects. \n\nAnother big point is that there are only something like 10 crops that are genetically modified and sold in America. So when something says \u201cnon GMO\u201d it never would\u2019ve had GMOs anyway. It doesn\u2019t make it healthier. I got a chocolate bar that said \u201cnon GMO\u201d and I was like ???? This is totally just a marketing scheme. \n\nHopefully this makes sense and doesn\u2019t get removed!",

        "selftext": "Baker Creek had started advertising a new tomato variety late last year called \"Purple Galaxy\", claiming that it was the first purple-fleshed tomato produced through conventional breeding. They had it all over social media and even had it on the front page of their seed catalog, but they updated their site in January to say that seeds would no longer be available because of some unspecified \"production issues\".\n\nIt all seemed a little fishy because there was a GMO purple-fleshed tomato variety coming to market at the same time produced by a company called Norfolk Healthy Produce. I emailed NHP on the 3rd asking if they knew anything about \"Purple Galaxy\" and they finally responded today, directing me to their recently updated [FAQ page](https://www.norfolkhealthyproduce.com/faqs) which now says:\n\n\" **We have received many questions about the purple tomato marketed by Baker Creek as \u201cPurple Galaxy\u201d in their 2024 catalogs. We understand from Baker Creek that they will not be selling seeds of this variety. \u00a0Given its remarkable similarity to our purple tomato, we prompted Baker Creek to investigate their claim that Purple Galaxy was non-GMO.\u00a0 We are told that laboratory testing determined that it is, in fact, bioengineered (GMO). This result supports the fact that the only reported way to produce a purple-fleshed tomato rich in anthocyanin antioxidants is with Norfolk\u2019s patented technology. We appreciate that Baker Creek tested their material, and after discovering it was a GMO, removed it from their website.** \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: To anyone freaking out about me being some anti-GMO fearmonger, I'm not. I'm a huge biology nerd and think the tech is cool, I even ordered the $20 seeds from Norfolk. Just spreading the word about what happened to Baker Creek's flagship release this year.",

        "selftext": " \n\nAlmost all of our food today, in terms of grain crops, has been modified and cultured in some way. Of course, it\u2019s not like they used CRISPR on corn two hundred years ago, but there is more than one way to modify food. With those modifications, though, come some serious controversies. People believe that these genetically modified crops can have a massively negative impact on our environment, which is often enforce by the mainstream media. I don\u2019t mean to scream fake news, as there is some real research there, but it doesn\u2019t tend to look at the entire picture. In an in-depth study conducted over 13 years involving more than 5,000 maize and 5,000 soy farms, researchers found that initial results of crops that produced their own herbicide and insecticide was positive, though over time weeds began to develop a resistance to the natural herbicide, causing many farmers to resort to buying their herbicide from manufacturers. However, this study was conducted not only on the impact on the *farmers*, not the farm, but also by an economist, not a biologist, geneticist, or even an anthropologist. It also focuses on one of the more recent modifications, one that only became prevalent in the USA after 1995, when the Environmental Protection Agency made it legal. Crops have been bred and modified for thousands of years, with one of the earliest examples being that of corn, which would have originally looked something closer to teosinte, or *Zea Luxurians*, a type of wild grass from Central and South America, eaten some 7,000\u20133,000 years ago (Grobman 1). Much of the corn we have today looks nothing like *Luxurians*, being almost a completely different species, *Zea Mays*. It grows well, and due to its natural domestication and modification through selective breeding, has a much lower impact on its environment than its \u201cGMO\u201d counterparts. These crops are plentiful, clean, and healthy for both us as humans and the environment they\u2019re grown in. That being said, there are some advantages that those GMO crops have over naturally bred produce. Many farmers have begun to recognize the ease with which GMO crops can grow, even if consumers don\u2019t recognize the benefits. That\u2019s why, from 1995 to 2004, less than ten years, the amount of GMO produce grown increased from 0 to approximately 90,000,000 hectares world wide. That number has only grown, despite popular opinion that GMOs are \u201cpoisonous\u201d and \u201ctoxic\u201d. There is a god chance you\u2019ve eaten some form of modified or specially bred crop, whether store-bought, in a restaurant, or out of a vending machine.\n\nMany people consider GMO crops to be poisonous or toxic. According to an article in *Scientific American*, \u201cMany people believe that GMOs are bad for their health \u2013 even poisonous \u2013 and that they damage the environment. This is in spite of overwhelming scientific evidence that proves that GMOs are safe to eat, and that they bring environmental benefits. . .\u201d (Blancke, 1). These people refuse to eat GMO crops, depending on their own feelings and assumptions about genetics, i.e. adding fish genes to tomatoes will make them taste \u201cfishy\u201d (they don\u2019t). These people refuse to accept scientific evidence of helpful GMO crops, similar to someone denying the positive medical effects of vaccines. There is a plethora of scientific evidence for GMOs, from positive environmental effects to economic advantages for farmers.\n\nGMO crops have, other than in select cases, a very positive influence on the environment, specifically in terms of conservation of habitats. GMOs have, in general, a much larger crop yield, meaning that they are more sustainable, and can feed more people with less land (Thompson 71). This means that natural ecosystems that otherwise would have been razed to make room for more farmland can now flourish in the way they would have had they never been adulterated by human development. That being said, many poorer subsistence farmers cannot afford these space saving GMOs, nor do they desire them, determined to remain dead-set in the agricultural practice known as \u201cslash and burn\u201d agriculture. This is when a farmer (or land company) cuts down and burns a section of rainforest to clear out space, farms it intensely until the soil is exhausted of nutrients, then moves on to a new piece of land. If these people would adopt the new GM crops, as well as modernized forms of rotational agriculture, land would be much more sustainable and even profitable after a time.\n\nAnother form of GMO crops are crops that produce their own insecticide. Don\u2019t confuse that with herbicide, another form of GMO with negative influence on a farm. Insecticide crops produce, essentially, natural pesticides. This is by use of a gene that is active against insects taken from the bacteria *Bacillus thuringiensis*, or Bt. These come in two primary forms, known commonly as \u201cBt Cotton\u201d and \u201cBt maize\u201d. Each are grown separately, and with their own drawbacks and advantages.\n\nBt Cotton:\n\nBt cotton is widely accepted and not heavily contested, as it is not consumed as food, so we won\u2019t spend much time on it. It is grown all around the world, with the primary advantage, of course, being a lack of pesticide use. Cotton farmers used more pesticide than any other farmers previous to the introduction of Bt cotton (Thompson 13), as there is essentially no demand for \u201corganic\u201d cotton, so no one particularly cared. Of course, people only really care about things that affect them, so it\u2019s understandable that no one would bat an eye about millions of square miles of land and ecosystem being systematically poisoned by thousands of farmers for decades. If no one cared, you might ask, why make Bt cotton a thing? The answer, my friend, is in the economics. A farmer has to pay for his insecticide, and if around four million pounds of it is dumped on cotton a year, that\u2019s a lot of money going to insecticide companies, which means a lot of money leaving the hands of farmers, for instance $500 million USD a year for China alone (Thompson 14). Cotton typically requires between five to twelve sprays with insecticide yearly, depending on the region it\u2019s grown in. When Bt cotton was introduced, people began to only need to spray cotton three to four times a year, at most nine, at least one, which cut pesticide use by around 50% (bear in mind that 20% of US farmers still grow natural cotton) (Thompson 13). Which is fantastic, just another two million pounds to go.\n\nBt Maize:\n\nBt maize is a much more touchy subject for most people. It's used in everything: breads, pastries, soft drinks, and of course, corn. Corn itself is not natural, obviously, so what makes Bt corn worse? Believe it or not, nothing. The first type of Bt corn was designed to keep insects away, and, as a side effect, make farmers spend less on pesticides (Thompson 22). That being said, the economic factor is not as large as it is with cotton. According to the EPA, \u201c\\[their\\] analysis of Bt crops finds that they pose no significant risk to the environment or to human health.\u201d  \n\nAlthough there are some cons to using specific forms of experimental GMO crops, i.e. crops that produce their own herbicide, the pros of almost all GMO crops far outweigh any minimal cons. There is a slight possibility that their impact will only be felt in long term effects, but we can never really be sure. The simplicity of moving agriculture from medieval England the the twenty first century is to adopt GMO crops as a source of food. With a population of 7.4 billion and growing, the only way for humans to survive and still conserve the natural world is to adopt higher yield GMO crops internationally. Much of the stigma around GMOs is similar to the popular fear of gluten, a harmless chemical found in grain that for some reason twenty and thirty somethings are deathly afraid of. GMOs are harmless, and can only improve and grow with new technology.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n1. Thomson, Jennifer A. *Seeds for the Future*. Cornell University Press, 2006\n2.

But for some reason I find arbitrary policy makers decided to group old GMOs which started to dominate the markets in the late 50s differently than new GMOs which follow the same genetic principles just applies the modification targeted instead of random.

        "title": "[Gardening] Norfolk making seed history + How Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds, one of the largest \"traditionalist anti-GMO\" seed distributors in the US, accidentally featured and tried to sell a Genetically Modified seed.",
        "selftext": "I'm just some hobbyist, correct me if I'm wrong. I repost now that the drama is \"old\", per the rules this time.\n\n#Background\n---\n###Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds\nA popular US seed company. If you would like more background see my [post below](https://old.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/1cuq9pw/gardening_norfolk_making_seed_history_how_baker/l4kacgs/).\n\n###Heirloom vs Non-Heirloom vs GMO\n- **Heirloom seeds** are grown with the intention to isolate desirable traits across many generations in order to produce one stable inbred line of plant genetics, resulting in predictable, genetically similar offspring. This is referred to as \"true to seed\".\n- **Non-heirloom seeds** are not inbred and carry a lot of variability. When two plants cross pollinate, they create a hybrid of the parents that results in offspring that express an unpredictable mix of genes. \n- **Genetically modified seeds** are engineered using gene editing technology, sometimes with genes from unrelated sources.\n\n\n###GMO and Patented seeds entering the consumer gardener market\n- In the consumer market, patents can be granted to **plants** such as roses and apples. One of the stipulations is that these plants have to be propagated asexually by cutting or (non-seed) tissue culture for the patent to be applicable. This means that it is permissible to save, sell, and grow seeds from these plants (if not sterile), because the offspring are not exact genetic copies.\n- Patent granting on **seeds** stipulates that the traits expressed cannot be the result of open pollination breeding (wind, insects). As a result, these patents are mostly applied to GMO seeds, where genes are manually influenced in a lab.\n- Previously, there were absolutely ***no GMO seeds sold to the consumer market due*** to USDA/FDA restrictions. Companies fearmongering about GMOs were easily dismissed. You simply could not buy GMO seeds outside of commercial applications.\n- The implications of GMO seeds, which are almost all patented, hitting the market is that the plants can cross pollinate with a non-patented plant, and pass patented genetics on to the offspring. The offspring would be the lawful IP of the company that owns the patent for as long as the patent is active (can be as long as 20 years).\n- Almost all gardeners rely on open pollination between their plants, so there is untread territory on what may happen down the line when more seeds of this nature become common place. \n- Despite this, the reception of new GMO varieties like the [purple tomato](https://www.norfolkhealthyproduce.com/) and [glow in the dark petunia](https://light.bio/faq/) has so far been largely positive.\n\n###Purple Tomatoes\n- Until now, attaining a tomato variety that was purple both inside and out and could reliably hold that genetic trait in its offspring was just out of reach for tomato enthusiasts. There have been many purple skinned varieties of tomatoes, and many that came close to having perfect [anthocyanin](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anthocyanin#) rich insides, but a company called Norfolk was the first to make it happen through science.\n\n---\n# The Controversy\n\n\n###Timeline\n- After 20 years of work, biochemist Cathie Martin and her team successfully isolates the gene that codes for color in a purple snapdragon flower and [integrates it into a tomato](https://www.opb.org/article/2024/02/06/purple-tomato-snapdragon-seeds/), making a first of its kind stable variety of purple fleshed tomato.\n- Norfolk makes headlines for getting the first [USDA approved](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/purple-tomato) GMO seed out to the consumer gardener market, obtaining a utility patent. \n- Around the same time, Baker Creek releases [a seed catalog](https://imgur.com/Vl9BIjH) boldly featuring a mysterious new purple fleshed tomato they called **Purple Galaxy**, as well as making [social media posts and videos](https://imgur.com/ofrcuzy) claiming it is non-GMO.\n- Across social media people begin to notice the striking similarities between the new tomato and the high publicity Norfolk Purple Tomato, finding the timing strange.\n\n###Speculation\n- [Speculation begins 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/tomatoes/comments/17m068s/baker_creeks_nongmo_purple_flesh_tomato/)\n\n   > - \"I think you\u2019re right that these look suspiciously related to Norfolk\u2019s GMO purple tomatoes due to the unique purple flesh and also the deep purple gel. But I find it highly unlikely that these actually are related since the purple GMO event was patented and anybody trying to monetize it would be clearly open to litigation.\"\n   > - \"It\u2019s funny how non-gmo is a thing with home gardeners. You can\u2019t even buy gmo seeds as a consumer.\"\n- [Speculation begins 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/1akcwog/this_looks_shockingly_similar_to_baker_creeks/)\n\n   > - \"This looks shockingly similar to Baker Creek's Purple Galaxy Tomato that mysteriously disappeared from availability this year.\"\n   > - \"Baker Creek are lying liars who lie. That whole catalog is a festival of photoshop, and then if you fall for it you'll only get about 30% germination.\"\n   > - \"I\u2019d be unsurprised if they are hypocrites, in addition to being wacky.\"\n   > - \"I really suspect that whoever bred the \"Purple Galaxy\" variety advertised by Baker Creek somehow got some leaked germplasm from Norfolk Healthy Produce's GM breeding program. I don't doubt that it's possible for a natural mutation to pop up that makes purple tomatoes\"\n\n###Baker Creek responds\n- Baker Creek [responds to concerns](https://imgur.com/Z1fgako) on social media:\n   > \"We have had every possible genetic test ran on these tomatoes to ensure they are Non GMO. This is a product of many years of selection work.\"\n\n- Shortly after, Baker Creek abruptly halts the sale of Purple Galaxy Seeds citing [unspecified \"production issues\"](https://imgur.com/hTNnBHE). Screenshot credit: [@Buckeye](https://growingfruit.org/t/non-gmo-purple-tomato/57747/5) on growingfruit.org\n\n- Baker Creek [pulls the listing](https://www.rareseeds.com/tomato-purple-galaxy) and deletes all social media posts about it, appearing to not acknowledge the tomato any further.\n\n- As u/fisch09 points out, a mysterious account named [u/heirloom23](https://archive.is/n3FMO) appears in the comments sections to speak on behalf of the company. It is unclear if this is an official company account, but at the very least it appears to be a loyal employee:\n> \"Labs are looking for specific genetic markers the first lab was looking for 2 specific genetic markers, which it did not contain. As stated in the FAQs, this was acquired from a country that does not allow GMO crops.\"\n\n\n\n###Norfolk responds\n[Norfolk releases a response](https://archive.ph/lSD6j) to the speculation that has flooded the internet:\n> **Is NHP's Purple Tomato related to the \"Purple Galaxy\"?**\n\n\n> We have received many questions about the purple tomato marketed by Baker Creek as \u201cPurple Galaxy\u201d in their 2024 catalogs. We understand from Baker Creek that they will not be selling seeds of this variety.  Given its remarkable similarity to our purple tomato, we prompted Baker Creek to investigate their claim that Purple Galaxy was non-GMO.  We are told that laboratory testing determined that it is, in fact, bioengineered (GMO). This result supports the fact that the only reported way to produce a purple-fleshed tomato rich in anthocyanin antioxidants is with Norfolk\u2019s patented technology. We appreciate that Baker Creek tested their material, and after discovering it was a GMO, removed it from their website.\n\n###r/Gardening reacts to Norfolk statement\n[Turns out the \"Purple Galaxy\" tomato advertised by Baker Creek was a GMO](https://old.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/1ase04e/turns_out_the_purple_galaxy_tomato_advertised_by/)\n\n> - \"Whatever your stance on GMO, I think we can all agree that companies have a legal and moral obligation to accurately represent their product to their customers.\"\n> - \"Baker Creek lied and possibly ripped off another company's IP? Color me absolutely not shocked.\"\n> - \"Baker Creek doesn't produce the majority of the seeds they sell, they buy them from seed farmers. But they should have known better when they saw a variety that appeared identical to a \"first ever\" gene edited strain in development.\"\n> - \"The problem is that they [Baker Creek] lied and said they tested it for GMO several times\"\n> - \"Being that Baker Creek has in previous years jumped all over the anti-GMO fearmongering, I'm howling at the irony.\"\n> - \"typical baker creek hot mess\"\n> - \"Bakers Creek lost my care or business with its shenanigans.\"\n\n###Norfolk goes ahead and posts the seeds for sale at [$20 for 10 seeds](https://www.norfolkhealthyproduce.com/)\n> - Seeds, fruit and plant material are only allowed in the USA.\n> - The seeds are a patented variety and are sold to enjoy in your home garden and with your local community.\n> - **No sales of fruit, seeds or plants** are permitted in this agreement, including any derived varieties.\n\n###[r/Gardening reacts to the patented GMO Purple Tomato seed itself](https://old.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/1akcwog/this_looks_shockingly_similar_to_baker_creeks/)\n> - \"This is why I grow heirloom.\"\n> - \"It will be interesting when people start making crosses with the trait.\"\n> - \"Really cool thing about this is that anthocyanins also delay rotting, so these tomatoes are more shelf-stable, making them more environmentally friendly. Anthocyanins are also good for us (like blueberries).  It\u2019s a pretty nifty and elegant design, I\u2019m excited to try them out.\"\n> - \"Just ordered some of these, can\u2019t wait to try them! I hope I can make purple spaghetti sauce and maybe even some purple ketchup later this year (if you know, you know.) Really cool! It\u2019s not every day you get to be part of a moment in food history.\"\n\n###[Baker Creek responds to the controversy after some considerable silence and reputational damage](https://archive.is/FYmEN)\n> BAKER CREEK DISCONTINUES PURPLE GALAXY TOMATO SEEDS\n> Baker Creek regrets to inform you that we will not sell seeds of the Purple Galaxy tomato, which we previewed in our 2024 catalogs. After repeated testing, we are unable to conclusively establish that the Purple Galaxy does not contain any genes that have been genetically modified. Baker Creek remains steadfast in its commitment to selling only heirloom and open-pollinated, non-Genetically Modified (\u201cnon-GM\u201d) varieties.\n\nThere is actually a whole rant after that by them about \"Big Ag\" despite them being one of the most well known online seed companies in the US, but you'll have to read that archive link for the rest.\n\n\n###The Empress Tomato\n\nThe purple tomato whose seed was sold to consumer gardeners is now being sold for a limited time in stores as [The Empress Tomato](https://www.freshplaza.com/north-america/article/9612731/prior-to-launching-demand-for-purple-tomato-already-exceeds-supply/) by Red Sun Farms.",

        "selftext": "\nBetween the years 624 and 628, Muhammed the Prophet led a campaign to totally and utterly annihilate the Jewish tribes of Medina after he failed to convert them to his new religion.\n\nThis is seen as a backstab to many historians because during Muhammed\u2019s initial Hegira to Medina, he stayed in the hospice of several Jewish tribes and was granted guest\u2019s right, where he incorporated several Jewish practices such as abstention from consumption of pork and praying several times a day to make his religion more enticing to the Jewish Medinan tribes.\n\nMuhammed would later craft a \u201cConstitution of Medina\u201d to lay the groundwork for his deposing of any tribes who opposed him. The Constitution outlined consequences for any tribe that violated the \u201cpeace\u201d of the city. \n\nUnder dubious circumstances, Muhammed first invoked its clause against the Jewish Banu Qaynuqa for the grand crime of \u201cplaying a prank on a customer\u201d and exiled them out of Medina under the threat of destruction, however the true motive was most likely so that Muhammed could remove the Qaynuqa\u2019s monopoly on trade and take it for himself. This isn\u2019t the only time Muhammed would create intricate legal frameworks as a means to seize power as he would later craft the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah as a means to depose the polytheist Banu Quraysh from Mecca.\n\nLater Muhammed forced the Banu Nadir who had historically been at odds with him since his self anointed declaration as a \u201cProphet\u201d into exile from Medina because they \u201cdid not support him in the Battle of the Trenches\u201d and did not \u201cshare dismay and sadness at his loss in the battle\u201d.\n\nLastly Muhammed invoked the Constitution once again on the Banu Qurayza for supposedly \u201caiding\u201d their sister tribe the Nadir. As punishment for their \u201ccrimes\u201d he ordered the execution of all the male members of the tribe and any old enough who \u201chad at least a single pube on their body\u201d by beheading. He later enslaved their women and children and took their belongings as his booty. The two most beautiful daughters of the leaders of the Jewish tribe of Qurayza he took for himself, Safiyyah and Rayhanah, and forced them into his concubine where he consummated their marriage with his 10th and 12th wife respectively who were at oldest 17 years of age.",

Feast upon some bite-sized morsels of organic drama.\n\n**You will eat ze ~~bugs~~ GMO celery!**\n> [Stop fear mongering. GMOs are safe, effective, and necessary.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1ekq6hm/comment/lgmgh1v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n>> Not only that, but in many cases GMOs are higher quality produce in general, including flavor. The reason so much grocery store produce tastes bland or outright bad is because of harvesting (i.e. ripening) practices. Stuff gets picked way before it's ripe and is then exposed to ethylene to get it to take on color. And for those scared of \"chemical-y\" words, no, ethylene is perfectly safe. Every fruit you have ever had produces it on its own. But yeah, your non-gmo organic produce would taste just as bad if it was mass-produced and processed in this manner.\n>>> What's higher quality? Non-gmo and organic have the qualities we need in produce. Gmo is genetically modified to look good longer, shelf life extended and costs are less to the consumer. But one major component is missing. They only contain half or less of the nutrients. That's why it's a choice to buy. Eat a couple gmo red peppers or the equivalent in one Nongmo /organic red pepper.\n>>>> This just isn't true. GMO crops are being developed to provide even more nutrients and combat nutritional deficiencies. For example, GMO \"Golden Rice\" with 23x more beta carotene to combat Vitamin A deficiency.\n\n**And the debate continues in the same thread**\n> [Safe and necessary? I don't know about that. Necessary to maximize profits? Yes. The idea that it's a solution to starvation is BS, we produced (and continue to produce) enough food, the thing stopping it from getting to people who need it is money. Safe? Maybe, it depends on what the modification is and how it's being used. One of the issues in the US is that most commercially grown GMO crops (corn and soy being the big ones) are modified to withstand much higher levels of (cancer causing) herbicide, so while the actual crop is by nature safe, what you buy at the store isn't necessarily. This is also why you should always buy organic tofu (and I say that as someone who does not always buy organic and is not opposed to GMOs... in theory).](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1ekq6hm/comment/lgmotlt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n>> The amount of ignorance in this unreal. You\u2019re just perpetuating myths fear mongering.\n>>> \"Corn is the most commonly grown crop in the United States, and most of it is GMO. Most GMO corn is created to resist insect pests or tolerate herbicides\" from the FDA\n>>>> Isn't pest resistant corn good? Lol, it reduces the need for pesticides for Christ sake.\n\n**The same user won't give up their GMO vendetta**\n> [Cancer causing pesticides are supposed to be washed off before eating your food. If you don't wash your produce, you are Darwin awarding yourself regardless of GMO status. Because if the carcinogens don't get you, the bioactive manure based fertilizers full of infectious disease will. Genetic modification is perhaps one of the safest routes available to food production. And is separate entirely from pesticide use. As long as you wash your damn food, you are fine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1ekq6hm/comment/lgn95ae/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n>> First of all I'm skeptical that herbicides are so easily removed from food by gently washing them, but let's say for the sake of argument that's all it takes, do you really think food manufactures are washing that food sufficiently before making it into a food product (I'm thinking lightly processed foods like tofu and soy sauce and corn tortillas)? I don't have that kind of faith in them. **more follows**\n>>> No. Food manufacturers have in fact never washed your produce for you. That is, has been, and will continue to be your responsibility since approximately 12,000 BCE when we started this whole farming thing. Did you miss all the dirt on your most recent lettuce head purchase? And also, being modified to resist herbicides does not have any direct ties to herbicides. If you had a gene inserted into you that made you immune to cyanide, it would not follow at all that you were contaminated with cyanide. It might mean that you would not know if you were contaminated with cyanide by virtue of not being dead, but you could also be entirely cyanide free. Pesticides are the same deal here. They are sprayed on plant surfaces and get washed off by rain weather and ideally before you eat them in your kitchen (apparently not yours though). There is a reason they need reapplied after storms.\n>>>> Ok good we agree on a little here. If food manufactures don't wash food products like soy and corn used to make things like tofu and corn tortillas (my previous examples), then we should not be eating them if they were made with crops raised with herbicides. I don't know where you're getting this crazy idea that I don't wash my food, I never said that, I just said I'm skeptical that washing is enough to remove herbicides. Technically you're not entirely wrong, just because food is genetically engineered to withstand herbicide, doesn't mean that it's necessarily grown with herbicide, and I would gladly welcome any information you have that shows that less than 90% of those crops are grown without herbicide, because I suspect you can't. They didn't make that genetic modification for kicks.\n>>>>> Of course processed food gets washed before manufacture. Unprocessed food and raw produce does not because it is fragile. Washing food tends to damage it, which is why you wash food right before consumption. Pesticides and herbicides don't stick on food any better than dirt does. In fact, most of those solutions actively do not get retained well. Which is why so much effort goes into trying to figure out how to make them stay on food long enough for it to grow.\n\n**Will GMO veggies give you the hershey squirts?**\n> [Fear mongering? There was an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association a number of years ago showing intestinal leakage in patients who ate large amounts of GMO produce](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1ekq6hm/comment/lgmh8gi/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n>> Jeeze... if you're going to mention an article/paper, then you might as well find it and include a link.

        "selftext": "Let me start by stating the obvious: Even given what little empirical data we have, the human health claims that contribute to GMO skepticism of the general public are unfounded and most are far-fetched.\n\n**However**, bad or even disingenuous arguments against GMOs do not rule out the existence of good arguments against GMOs. The general public (at least in their current state) has a predilection to reaction, conspiracism, and superstition. As such, you can find a lot of low hanging fruit on any side of any debate.\n\nWhen researching this topic, it's important to attempt to steel-man positions on both side, as well as get a good grasp on definitions... as they are used by the researchers using them.\n\nWhat you find when you steel-man GMO criticism: **By far the most credible and thoughtful concerns are coming from mainstream biology and the environmental sciences.** The concern is primarily that genetically modified organisms pose a considerable risk to native biodiversity.\n\n**Source 1:** Muir & Howard (1999). \"Possible ecological risks of transgenic organism release when transgenes affect mating success: Sexual selection and the Trojan gene hypothesis.\" *PNAS*. [https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.24.13853](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.24.13853)\n\nResearchers used a deterministic model to predict the outcome of the introduction of Japanese medaka (fish) modified with human growth hormone into wild populations. The model predicted the local extinction of both transgenic and wild populations, demonstrating the potential for catastrophic ecological damage caused by the release of transgenic organisms into the wild.\n\n**Source 2:** Tsatsakis et al. (2017). \"Environmental impacts of genetically modified plants: A review.\" *Environmental Research*. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2017.03.011)\n\n>Direct impacts include gene transfer, trait effects to non-target species as well as wild-life, invasiveness, weediness and genetic recombination of free DNA in the environment. On the contrary, indirect impacts include harmful and side effects of chemical control i.e. reduced efficiency of pest, disease and weed control, the effect on water and soil and global decline of biodiversity (Tutelyan, 2013).\n\nThere has even been some thorough confirmation of these concerns found while studying spillover events of GMO crops.\n\n**Source 3:** Sohn et al. (2021). \"A Review of the Unintentional Release of Feral Genetically Modified Rapeseed into the Environment.\" *Biology*. [https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10121264](https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10121264)\n\nGM Canola or rapeseed is a GMO weed that breeds with other weeds, passing on its herbicide tolerance:\n\n>\\[R\\]apeseed can produce wild populations in succeeding crops or appear as a volunteer outside of the crop area \\[31,42\\]. It has a number of wild relatives and is commonly found in Central Europe, which increases the chances of crossbreeding \\[30,33\\]. It can grow on both wasteland and cultivated land, forming persistent wild populations that can act as pollen donors and acceptors \\[31,32\\]. Most rapeseed plants beside the road have a high risk of spillage when seed sowing or harvesting equipment is transported, or when seeds are transported from fields or ports of import to processing facilities. The regional processes underlying the population dynamics of rapeseed have been extensively studied (Figure 3), including population statistics \\[43,44\\], seed sowing and harvesting machinery \\[44\\], and vehicle traffic \\[16,45\\]. According to the reports, gene flow through seeds can have a considerably larger impact on agriculture in terms of time and scale than gene flow through pollen \\[8,13\\] (Figure 3). Here, we further elaborate on the different types of unintentional environmental releases of GM rapeseed in countries where it is grown or imported (Table 2 and Table 3), as well as on the research trends in environmental risk assessment owing to unintentional environmental releases in major countries.\n\nSo, why is a laissez faire attitude towards GMOs so popular in \"skeptic\" communities? It seems that most skeptics have not evaluated all the arguments in favor of strong regulations on GMOs and instead focused only on the bad ones. Supporting an unregulated market in which multinational corporations run uncontrollable experiments on our biosphere doesn't seem too skeptical to me!",

I mean, even looking at the whole antivaax topic, even this has historically been a huge leftist-dominated domain, with Hollywood celebs like Jim Carrey, Mayim Bialik, Jenny McCarthy among others being huge anti-vaax advocates. How about instead of leftists sellfrighteously screaming that all of their political adversaries are just \"antiiscience\" LOOONS, they understand that they have just as many, if not more, anti-science bufooons in their midst. They by no means are the \"authorities\" on all science and have no latitude to invoke their mastery of it to win political arguments.

It's true that there are real advantages in poor countries (although I can't think of any real solid example backed by a study), but GMO labelling is just a small bit of information that don't seem to really matter that much.\n\nI have read that it would cost a lot to mark it on packages. How so ?\n\nThe genuine fear is that GMO labels sends the message that GMOs are bad in a way, and that consumers would not really understand the real meaning. The legal definition might not be accurate enough.\n\nUltimately the consumer should make the choice of what they buy, even if they make the wrong choice (the wrong choice would be to choose to buy or not buy GMO). Thus, GMO labels are neutral regarding GMOs. Arguing against labels is not arguing for GMOs, it's arguing against the choice of consumers. It is considering consumers are unable to make an adult decision.\n\n\n** EDIT **\n\nOkay, I will stop now, I think that's enough. It essentially boils down to uneducated consumers and the accurate scientific notion of what is a GMO. Not really happy with the answer, but I understand it better now.\n\n\n_____\n\n> *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Our farmer-led organization also runs a textile and dye farm in an effort to expand sustainable living beyond just food production. My community is against the presence of agrochemical corporations like Monsanto in Puerto Rico.\n\nNow, similar companies are seeping into the mountains where I live because the climate here is conducive to growing certain seeds. AJ+ featured my farmer friend in the [latest episode](https://youtu.be/5wXw_P7iugw) of \"Direct From With Dena Takruri,\" touching on how Monsanto's operation in Puerto Rico is affecting locals.
